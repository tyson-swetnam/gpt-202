## Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct applies to all Event participants, instructors, and activities during the workshop.

Data Science Institute (DSI) is dedicated to providing professional computational research
and educational experiences for all of our users, regardless of domain
focus, academic status, educational level, gender/gender
identity/expression, age, sexual orientation, mental or physical
ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or
lack thereof), technology choices, dietary preferences, or any other
personal characteristic.

While participating at an Event, we expect you to:

-   Interact with others and use ChatGPT professionally and ethically by
    complying with our Policies.
-   Constructively critize ideas and processes, not people.
-   Follow the Golden Rule (treat others as you want to be treated) when
    interacting online or in-person with collaborators, trainers, and
    support staff.
-   Comply with this Code in spirit as much as the letter, as it is
    neither exhaustive nor complete in identifying any and all possible
    unacceptable conduct.

We do not tolerate harassment of other users or staff in any form
(including, but not limited to, violent threats or language, derogatory
language or jokes, doxing, insults, advocating for or encouraging any of
these behaviors). Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate at any
time (excludes Protected Health Information in compliance with HIPAA).
Any user violating this Code may be expelled from the platform and the
workshop at DSI's sole discretion without warning.

To report a violation of this Code, directly speak to a trainer. If you are not comfortable
speaking to a trainer, or the trainer is who you are reporting, email <info@cyverse.org> with the following information:

-   Your contact information
-   Names (real, username, pseudonyms) of any individuals involved, and
    or witness(es) if any.
-   Your account of what occurred and if the incident is ongoing. If
    there is a publicly available record (a tweet, public chat log,
    etc.), please include a link or attachment.
-   Any additional information that may be helpful in resolving the
    issue.
